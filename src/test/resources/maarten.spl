  You are as small as the difference between the square of the difference between my little pony
  and your big hairy hound and the cube of your sorry little codpiece.
  You are as bottomless as the sum of yourself and a horrid infected lying miserable son.

  you are the sum of Agamemnon and my little healthy pony!

  Speak your mind!
